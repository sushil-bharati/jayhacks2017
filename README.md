# Kiddo - Your personalized PC Assistant
Kiddo was born in Jayhacks event. JayHacks is the hackathon at the University of Kansas. I participated in Jayhacks, 2017 and was much fun and learning. Recommended.

Event: Jayhacks , Feb 17-19, 2017
Location: LEEP 2 Building, University of Kansas, Lawrence, 66045

Developers: Sushil, Manjish

Purpose: Virtual PC Assistant - Kiddo is developed to help any individual do the common chores as well as entertain in
much easier and modern way. Your personal PC assistant comes in two mode - Speech and Text. You can interact in either
way - through your melodious voice or through your mobile when you run sore throat.
Imagine waking up one lazy Saturday morning. How do you want to start your day? Perhaps sleep again?
Well, our specially designed assistant can play you a right music from your music library (depending on your mood) on one
go. Kiddo can update you with temperature outside so that you have the right clothes for your brisk walk. What more?
Your personalized PC assistant can update you with current twitter hashtag trends or simply keep you in conversation
if you are feeling too low. Clocks not working? Well, Kiddo has got you covered. Just ask for time and your assistant
will update you right away. Busy person? Kiddo can synchronize with your Google Calendar and help you plan out your
entire year.. or perhaps week if you are a student like me. Can you ask for more? Totally yea! Kiddo comes with built in
games (text mode) to keep you going when your best friend went for a week vacation. Did I mention that Kiddo can
read out your horoscope to you?

Future Work:

1. Integrating Artificial Intelligence to learn more sentiments of the people around

2. Implementation of Computer Vision (For example, Facial Recognition) for smart assistant

3. Further improvement on Natural Language Processing and Voice recognition software than existing

4. Making Kiddo more flexible on user end

5. Further updates(ver. Youngo)- News Headlines Reader, Movie Recommendations (personalized Machine Learning in Netflix)
